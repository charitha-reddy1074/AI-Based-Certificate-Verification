# PostgreSQL Setup for CertChain

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL installed and running on port 5432

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Start PostgreSQL Service
- Open Services (services.msc) or use pg_ctl to start PostgreSQL
- Or use the PostgreSQL installer tray icon to start the service

### 2. Create Database and User
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```bash
# Login as postgres user (default password is usually empty or 'postgres')
psql -U postgres

# Inside psql shell:
CREATE DATABASE certchain_db;
CREATE USER certchain_user WITH PASSWORD 'certchain123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE certchain_db TO certchain_user;
\q
```

### 3. Verify Connection
```bash
psql -U certchain_user -d certchain_db -h localhost -p 5432
# Should connect successfully
\q
```

### 4. Push Database Schema
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 5. Test Connection
```bash
npm run dev
# Should show "✓ Connected to PostgreSQL" in logs
```

## Current Status
- ✅ .env file created with DATABASE_URL
- ⏳ PostgreSQL service needs to be started
- ⏳ Database and user need to be created
- ⏳ Schema needs to be pushed

## Notes
- The project uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Tables: users, certificates, verifier_unlocks
